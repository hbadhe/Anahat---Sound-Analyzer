ANAHAT - Sound Analysis Application
Overview
ANAHAT is a web-based acoustic analysis tool designed to make sound exploration accessible and intuitive. The app records brief audio samples (3 seconds) and provides instant feedback on key acoustic properties, democratizing sound analysis for musicians, speech therapists, educators, and curious learners alike.
Philosophy & Function
The philosophy behind ANAHAT is immediate insight through simplicity. Rather than overwhelming users with complex spectrograms and technical jargon, it distills acoustic analysis into understandable categories: sound type (vowels, consonants, humming), intensity levels, texture qualities, and musical pitch. It's built on the principle that understanding sound shouldn't require a PhD in acoustics—just curiosity and a voice.
